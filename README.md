**DroidHub** is a next-generation platform for real-time remote robot control, live video streaming, and decentralized staking. Compete for control, drive real robots, and interact with a global audienceâ€”all from your browser.

## Bridging Blockchain and the Physical World
DroidHub lets anyone with a wallet and AVAX tokens stake for control of real robots. The top staker gets exclusive access to the robot's control panel, while everyone else can watch, chat, and compete for the next turn. All logic is trustless and transparent, powered by smart contracts.
